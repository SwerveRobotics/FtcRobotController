package com.example.roboticseducation.examples.session1;

// This class serves the purpose of printing the words "Hello world!" to the console.
// It can be called anything you want (within identifier constraints)
// More on why the blue words are necessary later!
public class HelloWorld {
    // This method contains the instructions for what the class will do when run.
    // It must be called "main".
    // More on the blue words and why they are necessary later!
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This statement does the printing.
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
