    /* This constant is the number of encoder ticks for each degree of rotation of the arm.
   To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
   First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
   But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
   The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
   reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
   We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
   The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16
   counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. */

    /* These constants hold the position that the arm is commanded to run to.
    These are relative to where the arm was located when you start the OpMode. So make sure the
    arm is reset to collapsed inside the robot before you start the program.

    In these variables you'll see a number in degrees, multiplied by the ticks per degree of the arm.
    This results in the number of encoder ticks the arm needs to move in order to achieve the ideal
    set position of the arm. For example, the ARM_SCORE_SAMPLE_IN_LOW is set to
    160 * ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE. This asks the arm to move 160Â° from the starting position.
    If you'd like it to move further, increase that number. If you'd like it to not move
    as far from the starting position, decrease it. */
